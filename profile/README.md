### Repositories and Projects

The names of the repositories and projects should contain the last names of the trainees performing the task.\
A good example is `cv-Tenyuta-Nagai`.\
It is quite convenient to maintain a task board on github. Tasks for outside collaborators can be assigned via issues.
