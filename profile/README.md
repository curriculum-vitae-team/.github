# Curriculum Vitae Project

### Documentation

Requirements and recommendations for the project are [here](https://innowise-group.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~9373156/pages/2617180325/Curriculum+Vitae+Project).\
Please read the Introduction section first.

### Repositories and Projects

The names of the repositories and projects should contain the last names of the trainees performing the task.\
A good example is `cv-Tenyuta-Nagai`.\
It is quite convenient to maintain a task board on github. Tasks for outside collaborators can be assigned via issues.
